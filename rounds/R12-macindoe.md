# Round 12 — Macindoe to Merle

*Reply to Merle's round-11 letter of 2026-07-30 (`rounds/R11-merle.md` at `d48ba9e` in his
Lean repository). Delivered under §13's accepted proposal: the technical half of this
correspondence enters the shared repository one round per pull request, with the second
key being the approving review. This file carries the business paragraphs only — the
personal half of the reply travels by mail, per the accepted split.*

---

## 1. Your §5, answered first, since you asked to know quickly.

The binning convention you guessed is exactly ours. `experiments/merle_r11_hygiene_check.py`,
function `gk_stats`: classes `{1}, ..., {B-1}, {>=B}` for the binning parameter `B`, with
`dof = B-1` and a closed-form tail probability for the last class. That is the convention
your §5 restated, and your argument built on it stands. One honest caveat, though: our
committed run tried thirteen binnings (`B ∈ {3,5,7,9,10,11,12,15,18,20,25,30,40}`), not
all thirty-eight `B ∈ [3,40]`. Your exhaustive maximum over the full range,
`max chi2/dof = 0.56657 < 0.567`, is verified on our side and is the stronger statement —
it is true, and it closes a gap our own run left open.

Your REQ-067 defect is verified in full, independently, from a fresh continued-fraction
implementation. The expansion your script built at `mp.dps = 400` diverges from the true
continued fraction of `log_2 3` at index 385 (0-based); 1615 of the 2000 terms taken were
rounding noise, not partial quotients. On the corrected sequence the figure is `0.00078`,
not `0.00103`, and all six of your comparison numbers reproduce to the digit: largest bin
deviation `0.008425`, chi2/N over the complete partition `0.001214`, and the exhaustive
`max chi2/dof < 0.567` bound at `0.5666` — none of which our reimplementation of the wrong
sequence reproduces (`0.004496` / `0.001249` / `1.0504` there). The fix at `dps = 3000`
with the doubled-precision canary is exactly the right remedy, and the substantive
conclusion is unchanged: `log_2 3` is a statistically ordinary irrational.

## 2. The L-A9 verdict: the attack, delivered flat.

Your delta-8 entry asked for exactly one thing checked hardest — the grade line — and we
attacked it clean-room, in fresh code importing nothing from either of your repositories.
The verdict: the arithmetic is flawless (every figure reproduces to the digit, including
the two you flagged as approximate), and the impossibility conclusion is **confirmed and
strengthened** — it survives the sharp chain, every constant convention, the Hurwitz
boundary case, and a golden-ratio negative control. What does not survive the attack is
the grade line's stated margin. `c* ≈ 0.9617` is the linear-form exponent (Dirichlet floor
`c ≥ 1`); "no irrational has an effective exponent below 2" is the measure convention
(floor `μ ≥ 2`, and `μ = c* + 1 ≈ 1.96`). Paired in one sentence they read as a gap of
roughly 1.04; in either single convention the route is actually shut by **0.04 to 0.08 in
the exponent** — a razor, not the distance the pairing suggests. The "diophantine dream
`c = 2`" clause has the same displacement: it names the measure exponent `μ = 2`, but the
deficits beside it (the missing factor 7159.5 on `k`, the `2^38.4` of computation) are
computed at `μ = 3`, a regime nothing conjectures for `log_2 3`. At the true dream
(`μ = 2, κ = 1`) the deficit is a factor of only 1.96 on `k` and `2^1.95` of computation.
Two smaller notes travel with it: "Salikhov's real `c = 5.125`" is Salikhov's measure of
`ln 3`, not `log_2 3` — the same transplant our la7-mu check already adjudicated — and the
"exact Barina bound `2075*2^60`" is an unarchived project-counter snapshot, not a citable
figure; the paper-stated bound is `2^71`. Worth noting as a cross-check rather than a
coincidence: the one-power-of-`k` gap between your `c` and the measure exponent `μ = c+1`
is the same `+1` conversion the Rhin adjudication below derived independently, converting
a height-based bound into a per-index measure.

The scissors half replicates entirely and is honestly labelled measured. Extended to
`2^2000` it gains scope (full chord `0.5001`, comfortably above 1/3); at width it loses
some (30-bit windows dip to `0.3229`, below 1/3 — the claim is safe from about 100-bit
widths upward, which is where your own grid sits). And `alpha > 1/3` is the right
threshold only in the entry's own convention: against the true Dirichlet floor the
forever-form of the claim needs `alpha > 1/2`, and the measurement **straddles** it — your
own band is 0.482-0.511, our extended chord is 0.5001. The race at the floor is a photo
finish the measurement cannot decide, though it does decide the race for every published
or reachable effective exponent. This is not a defect to fix; proving `alpha > 1/3` is
itself a `mu(log_2 3) <= 3`-class statement, so "measured, not proved" is the right grade
permanently, not provisionally.

Split-grade key turn, offered in the ledger: the Dirichlet half — the claim, the chain
reduction, the floor argument — is ready to turn as unconditional theorem-grade,
conditional on offer h1 there (the single-convention restatement). The scissors half
stays at measured grade for good. Five offers, h1 through h5, are drafted inside the L-A9
entry.

## 3. The Rhin answer: adjudicated, and it is good news.

Your two public artifacts split cleanly on this one: the Lean rule is right, the BILAN is
wrong, and the BILAN's error has an identifiable, honorable mechanism. The primary
statement is Rhin 1987 (Progress in Mathematics 71, pp. 155-164), Proposition p. 160: for
all integers `u0, u1, u2` with `H = max(|u1|,|u2|)`, `|u0 + u1 log 2 + u2 log 3| > H^(-13.3)`
— a linear-form bound covering `(log 2, log 3)` directly, which is the "tres bonne mesure
d'independance lineaire sur Z effective de 1, log 2 et log 3" of the paper's own zbMATH
review (Zbl 0632.10034), proved in the same paper whose title instrument is Padé-type
irrationality measures. The paper contains both; your BILAN's premise ("Rhin traite des
mesures d'irrationalite, pas des formes lineaires en 2 logarithmes") sees the first half
and denies the second. Simons-de Weger 2005 apply precisely this Proposition (Lemma 12:
`Lambda > e^(-13.3(0.46057+log K))`, proof, verbatim: "We apply the Proposition on p. 160
of [Rh] with u0 = 0, H = u1 = K + L, and u2 = -K"), stating in the same section that for
`x log 2 + y log 3` "the result of Rhin [Rh] is best"; an independent generalized-Collatz
application (arXiv:2205.10582, Lemmas 10/12) makes the same application with both height
cases exercised. Your BILAN's Laurent 2008 ~= 18.5 and LMN 1995 ~= 23.55 are constants of
a different instrument: in Laurent 2008 they sit in the C2 row of Table 1 (25.2 down to
17.9) multiplying `D^4*(log b'+...)^2*log A1*log A2` — coefficients of a `(log)^2`
expression, not exponents on the height — so they cannot stand in for 13.3, and for this
specific pair the Padé route beats them, which is why the cycle literature uses Rhin. What
your audit caught was nonetheless real: R200 had written "Rhin (1987): |S*log2-k*log3| >
exp(-13.3*(log S)^2)" — the LMN shape with Rhin's constant transplanted into it. That
statement is indeed not Rhin's; drop the square and it is, verbatim. The auditor rejected
the attribution where the defect was the transcription. So: 13.3 stands for exactly what
L-A7 consumes, the headline `n ~ 2233` and every committed number stand unmoved, L-A7's
source line needs no edit, and BILAN_R201's R201-I3 "PROUVE" is the artifact to retire —
on its own record's terms, since your re-sourced rule already carries the correct
statement. Your structural point survives at any value, as you said. One boundary we
carry jointly, unchanged from round 9: neither side has yet read p. 160 in the 1987
volume itself; the two published applications apply the Proposition with no threshold
clause from heights of a few hundred, and L-A7's use only needs `H = K0 >= 952` — but if a
library copy is reachable on your side, that one look closes the last gap in the pin.
Recorded in the ledger as a flat adjudication; no number in L-A7 moves.

## 4. Your §4 acceptances, entered as ours.

Three items, one sentence each, mechanisms named, entered in the L-A8 ledger block.

The displayed `D(x_min) = delta*(1 + 1/(27*x_min^2))` was wrong, and it is our error: it
is the truncation of a positive series after its first correction term, not an identity.
What is exact is the strict chain `D(x) > delta*(1 + 1/(27x^2)) > delta` for every
`x > 1/3` — the direction of everything built on it survives; only the equals sign did
not. Mechanism: an asymptotic taken for an identity, undetectable at the scale this
correspondence works in — structurally the same shape as your own §4(a), as you said.

The diagnosis we both reached — "the two sides agree to 44 decimal places, which is
presumably why it reads as exact" — is also refuted, jointly. The ratio
`sum_i D(x_i)/(n*D(x_min))` is scale-invariant at `0.4755266037564546...` for the `-17`
shape at every scale we rebuilt it at, because to leading order it is a pure function of
shape; no scale makes it converge to 1. What agrees to 44 decimals at `2^71` is the
per-step pair `D(X)` against `delta`, and that convergence was transferred to the sum, by
both of us.

And the credit record, exactly as you fixed it: the two-shore factor-2 reading is jointly
arrived at (the identification ours, the frame it lands on yours); the corollary is
yours, the carrying proof (uniqueness via `3(3x+1) = 4(3x-1)`, one linear equation, one
root, `D` strictly decreasing) is ours — so `x = 1` is the only odd positive integer at
which the sign information exceeds the drift, and that integer is the trivial cycle.
Nothing here needed correcting on our side beyond the two sentences above; both drafted
corrections sit in the ledger, in the L-A8 block, directly under the theorem hand-back.

## 5. The §9 answer: all fourteen claims verified, and the block is in.

Every one of your fourteen claims in the rotation reformulation was recomputed from
scratch and confirmed: the Sturmian step sequence at slope `log_2(3/2)`, not `log_2 3`;
the closed-form `maxgap(J) = max(theta, 1 - J*theta)` for `J <= 13`; and the new result —
the plateau `maxgap(J) = theta` exactly for `J = 13..25`, first falling at `J = 26` to
`14*theta - 1`. Your "cost, not failure" arithmetic is exact: losing `theta <= l` widens
the sweep from 66 to 131 consecutive integers, which the window `[L^p, 1.05*L^p]` first
supplies at `p = 18` rather than `p = 16` — two periods added to the finite check, priced
to the digit.

The block is incorporated: `cycles.md` 12.8.6.1's marked section, between *What is
consumed* and *Superseded formulation*, under both our names, exactly where you asked for
it and in your own words with the theorem and its constants untouched. Wiki commit
`e586d35`.

## 6. The §10 answer: the silence, answered.

Your item 2 from round 11 is confirmed absent from our round-11 reply — we checked the
full text and found no sentence on it, exactly as you say. The silence is real, and it is
total on two of its three clauses. The **memory** clause survives independently: it was
re-established on the corrected instrument (real continued fractions on a common
footing, not the disowned i.i.d. Gauss-Kuzmin null) and replicated on our side. The
**clustering** and **spectral** clauses were never touched here — the four numbers you
quoted (`0.831`, the control range, the two variance ratios) occur nowhere in our record
outside the transcription of your own letter, and the detector's spec (the peak
definition and threshold, the null behind the control ranges, the series length) is not
recoverable from what we have.

Recommendation: retain the conclusion with a scope clause, not flat and not struck. The
memory clause stands on the corrected footing, both sides. The clustering and spectral
clauses stand as yours, unreplicated, on your side of the ledger. And to your question
directly: the stopping rules do **not** place this out of reach — no cycle search is
involved, and the equidistribution rule explicitly allows experiments to feed the ledger.
What places it out of reach today is the unrecoverable detector spec, and that is yours to
supply if you want the second key: one clause each for the peak definition and threshold,
the null behind the control ranges, and the series length, and replication on our side
becomes a cheap computation on the continued fraction of `log_2 3`.

## 7. Your §§1-2: closed at full weight.

We re-cloned both repositories and checked point by point, and all three of round 11's
not-found verdicts are closed, at full weight. `AUDIT_V9` is public at `audits/` on
`proof-assembly-v1` at `98b2de6` with the date you named, and its parent is the commit
that GitHub's own push log shows as origin's tip from 18 March until 29 July — so "exactly
one commit ahead, never pushed" is what the graph says, not just what you say. `STATUS.md`
is committed with line 52 replaced by its reason, and the three things you said it says,
it says verbatim. And we counted the `PROOF_ASSEMBLY.md` markers ourselves at `b38758d`
and got eighteen, your named lines where you named them, nothing deleted, and the two
copies byte-identical at every one of the six commits — we compared the committed blobs,
one step stronger than the working-copy diff you ran, and they agree at every stage.
Round 11's posture sentence — absence of a public copy is not evidence against the
account — resolves here exactly the way it was written to allow. One count of ours for
your sequence: under a single convention (in-place markers, the block's own heading
excluded) we get 7 -> 15 -> 18 rather than 7 -> 14 -> 18, and your carry-commit says
sixteen — three stated counts, three conventions, converging only at the end. That is not
a correction of the finding; it is a fourth instance of it, and your remedy sentence
already covers all four: the pattern and the range, never the tally.

## 8. Two small corrections, ours.

Your 3,100-byte figure for `LegendreApprox.lean` is right; our 3,175 is a working-copy
measurement, not a blob size. Both blobs are `git cat-file -s` = 3,100 bytes (75
LF-terminated lines, no CR); under this machine's CRLF checkout each copy measures
3,100 + 75 = 3,175 bytes on disk, which is the figure we printed. "Same size each" stands;
the honest byte count is yours.

Your §10.2 correction is confirmed in every particular: `docs/PROOF_ASSEMBLY.md` prints
exactly fifteen partial quotients of `log_2 3` — `[1; 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 23, 2, 2, 1,
1, 55, ...]` — and cites Jackson-Matthews 2002 for the 10,000-term computation; it does
not itself give the expansion to 10,000 terms. Our sentence overstated the file's own
contribution; the point about the antecedent convergent-confinement result stands either
way.

## 9. The erratum answer: the section that changed.

The sequence question is answered by the fact: **v3 is published**, 2026-08-03, DOI
10.5281/zenodo.21730505 (verified live: the version-specific DOI resolves, dated
2026-08-03, listed as a new version of the v2 DOI). And the delta from what we described
to you needs to be stated plainly, in your own §2 vocabulary: what we described as a
drafted one-sentence erratum shipped as a full revision after external review — the
object shipped is a superset of the object described.

What the revision is, in one paragraph: every definition, statement and scope word was
brought back into line with the project record — `Def 2.1` gains `omega > 0`; `Thm 3.3`'s
bound is corrected to `(1 + log d)^2`, the printed form having been false at `d = 1`;
`Thm 3.8` states its window with the stratum labels; `n_0(p)` is defined explicitly; the
digit budget is demoted to a labelled heuristic; `Section 5` is restated around one
object, one clock, and one hypothesis in ensemble form. The *Note added in v2* and its gap
sentence are replaced by a *Status of the assessment* paragraph; the old sentence is no
longer in the paper, and the narrative of how the route changed lives in
`paper/collatz-reduced-version-history.md`, in the project record. The document shortened
from 18 pages to 15. No numbered theorem's claim is strengthened, weakened or renumbered,
and nothing new is proved in the paper itself.

Citation guidance: **v3** for the dichotomy phrases — both verified verbatim, surviving
unchanged: "a sharp dichotomy for counting arguments" and "the counting-limit dichotomy
developed here" — and for Theorem 4.6's closing obstruction sentence ("uniform cycle
exclusion therefore requires the divisibility system — equivalently, rigidity of the
closed anchor walk"), which is still inside the theorem environment; what moved out of
that environment in v3 is only the `gamma = O(log p)` assessment, so the environment now
carries only proved content — a cleaner citation target than before. **v2** for the
contiguous `p in {2,...,23}` evidence note, which v3's Status paragraph replaces.

Canonical-citation line: the published record is amended; paper 1 is at v3 (version DOI
10.5281/zenodo.21730505), one canonical object under the concept DOI ("Cite all
versions" on the Zenodo record page); the correction sits in what was Section 4's v2
note, restated as the Status paragraph. The ccchallenge `Macindoe2026` entry is catalogued
from the v1 export; this is noted flat, and the citation above states the canonical DOI
rather than chasing the register.

One more thing, self-reported at full grade before you find it, since that is the
standard you set and the standard we intend to hold to: the published PDF's own Version
note still carries its drafting-time self-description — "drafted; the version-specific
DOI on the title page is reserved and this version is not yet published" — frozen into
the immutable file at upload, even though the title page above it carries the real,
resolving DOI. Recorded in the version-history file. The remedy is a Zenodo metadata note
(metadata stays editable after publication); that note is the author's to write.

## 10. Your §12, business half.

I accept the two-page-note shape — the counting dichotomy plus the located obstruction,
every other prerequisite deferred to a second version — and the erratum precondition set
for it is now met.

I'm happy to take the pen. The drafting capacity on my side is not the bottleneck, and
you have provided the concrete base to work from: a first draft of the note will follow
as its own pull request this week. Taking the pen also resolves §11's abstract question —
the pen-holder creates the place for the position paragraph. We continue to rely on the
both-keys-turned convention for verification and critique: nothing enters the signed
version on one key.

On cost: the rhythm is not heavy at this end, and nothing needs slowing. Spend caps are
in place and held — one review agent was cut off mid-run this round at a model-specific
allocation, not the monthly cap, and resumed cleanly a few hours later with its
mid-flight conclusions re-derived rather than trusted; your own failure mode in
different units, and the symmetry is noted. The real constraint on my side is latency,
not budget: a solution takes sometimes three minutes and sometimes three hours, and I am
not always available the moment an agent finishes. The fuller answer travels by mail.

## 11. Your §13, answered by the object itself.

This pull request is the proposal enacted rather than merely accepted: one round, one
pull request, and the second key is your approving review — on the round's content and,
per §4(d), on the regime column now sitting in `PROTOCOL.md` beside the two keys, which
enters this ledger by your own proposal.
